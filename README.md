Generate a strong, unique password for every website!

This browser extension generates a strong password based on a master password and an input, usually a url. This means you'll have a strong, unique, generated password for every website, yet only need to remember one password. The master password still needs to be a strong password, but that is your own responsibility.

The master password is never stored, but the urls (or other input) are stored in the browser's storage, so that you don't need to remember if that password contained special characters.
